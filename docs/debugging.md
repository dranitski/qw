# Debugging

qw has some basic debug output functionality. Note that currently, most of its
internal variables are local and are not accessible directly. All of its
functions are global, however, and can be run normally via the clua console.

## Debugging rc variables

This variables should be configured in the qw rc file.

* `DEBUG_MODE`

  Set to `true` to enable debug mode by default. Debug mode causes debug
  messages to be printed according to the enabled channels defined in
` DEBUG_CHANNELS`.

* `DEBUG_CHANNELS`

  A list of debug channel names that will have debugging messages printed when
  debug mode is enabled. The available channels are:

  + "combat": Melee targeting and combat.
  + "flee": Fleeing evaluation.
  + "goals": Current goal and travel destination.
  + "items": Item evaluation.
  + "map": Updates to the map data and distance maps.
  + "move": Movement evaluation.
  + "plans": The last successfully executed plan.
  + "plans-all": The results of every plan in the cascade. Generates a lot of output.
  + "ranged": Ranged targeting and combat.
  + "retreat": Retreat position evaluation.
  + "skills": Skill selection.
  + "throttle": Throttling and memory usage.

  Also see the `toggle_debug_channel()` function.

* `SINGLE_STEP`

  Set to `true` to disable automatic made and have qw take one action at a time
  with the *Tab* key. You can also toggle this with the `toggle_single_step()`
  function.

* `WIZMODE_DEATH`

  Set to `true` to have qw accept death if it loses all HP in Wizard Mode. By
  default it keeps playing.

## Debugging functions

These can be executed from the clua console.

* `override_goal(goal)`

  Have qw attempt the goal given in `goal`. Here `goal` is a string giving a
  single goal in the format describe in [README.md#goals]. One this goal is
  completed, qw will resume its configured goal list.

* `toggle_single_step()`

  Toggle whether qw takes a single action with each use of the *Tab* key.

* `toggle_debug()`

  Enable/disable debug mode. qw's debugging messages are never printed when
  debug mode is disabled, regardless of which debug channels are enabled.

* `toggle_debug_channel(channel)`

  Enable/disable output for the debug channel named `channel` (string).

* `disable_all_debug_channels()`

  Disable all debug channels.

* `toggle_delay()`

  Enable or disable the use of the delay as configured in the `DELAY_TIME` RC
  variable.

* `toggle_throttle()`

  Enable or disable the use of the coroutine to break up longer calculations by
  sending non-operational input.

* `reset_coroutine()` and `resume_qw()`

  If qw has errored, use `reset_coroutine()` to delete the current coroutine.
  Use `resume_qw()` to tell qw to resume execution.

### Diagnostic Functions

* `get_vars()`

  Get local tables that contain internal qw information. This returns the
  following tables in order:

  1. `qw`: qw state information. Currently most state resides in inaccessible
     local variables, but in the future these will all be moved into the `qw`
     table.
  2. `const`: Various constants values and enums.

* `dsay(x)`

  Say `x` the message log, converting `x` to a string. This conversion works
  on tables and prints a nested representation of the table contents. Functions
  and userdata object can't be printed with `dsay()`.

* `debug_channel(channel)`

  Returns true if the given debug channel is enabled. Use this when adding
  permanent debugging statements to condition printing the message on whether
  the corresponding debug channel is enabled. For performance reasons, any code
  involving complicated string creation or additional calculations that would
  execute frequently should be conditional on the results of a call to
  `debug_channel()`.

* `print_traversal_map(center)` and `print_unexclusion_map(center)`

  Print 20 squares from the position `center` of the traversal or unexclusion
  map. The `center` argument defaults to (0, 0), the player's position. In
  these maps, `.` represents traversable/unexcluded, `#` represents
  untraversable/excluded, and `nil` means the position is still unseen. The
  player, if within 20 squares of `center`, is represented by `@`, `7`, or `✞` if
  the player's position is traversable/unexcluded, untraversable/excluded, or
  `nil`, respectively. If center is not (0, 0), it is represented by `&`, `8`,
  or `W` for the same corresponding map states used to describe the player.

* `print_distance_maps(center, excluded)`
  and `print_distance_map(dist_map, center, excluded)`

  Print 20 squares from the position `center` of all distance maps or the given
  distance map. If `excluded` is true, print the exclusion-aware distance map,
  otherwise print the map that ignores exclusions. Distances for traversable
  squares are shown as ASCII symbols based on the distance, starting with `A`
  represent 0. For distances from 61 to 180, a `Ø` is shown, and for distances
  above 180, `∞` is shown. The player and center positions are represented the
  same way as for `print_traversal_map()`.

## Batch runs of qw

Use `claude/run-parallel.py` to run qw games in parallel with health monitoring
and real-time limits. See `claude/run-parallel.md` for full documentation.

## Miscellaneous tips for coding and testing

* You can run qw with the DCSS command-line option `-seed <n>` or by setting
  the seed with the `game_seed` RC option. This gives the same generated
  dungeon every game for more reproducible testing, although combat RNG will
  still vary.

* qw outputs its version string and current configuration as notes at the start
  of every game. These can be viewed from the in-progress game dump and the
  final game morgue. The version string is updated by the `make-qw.sh` script
  based on `git describe`.
